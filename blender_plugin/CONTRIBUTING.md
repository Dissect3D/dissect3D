# AI Usage Policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project does **not** accept pull requests that are fully or predominantly AI-generated. AI tools may be utilized solely in an assistive capacity.
>
> Detailed information regarding permissible and restricted uses of AI can be found in the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

Code that is initially generated by AI and subsequently edited will still be considered AI-generated. AI assistance is permissible only when the majority of the code is authored by a human contributor, with AI employed exclusively for corrections or to expand on verbose modifications that the contributor has already conceptualized (e.g., generating repeated lines with minor variations).

If AI is used to generate any portion of the code, contributors must adhere to the following requirements:

1. Explicitly disclose the manner in which AI was employed.
2. Perform a comprehensive manual review prior to submitting the pull request.
3. Be prepared to explain every line of code they submitted when asked about it by a maintainer.
4. Using AI to write pull request descriptions or to respond to human reviewers is strictly prohibited.

For more info, please refer to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file.

# Coding guidelines

All Python code in this repository should follow PEP 8 with the conventions below.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Use Unix line endings (LF, \n).
- Add spaces around operators (except for keyword arguments).
- Maximum line length: 120 characters.
- Remove trailing whitespace.

Naming conventions
- Use CamelCase for:
    - classes
    - exception types
- Use underscore_case for:
    - variables
    - functions
    - modules

String quotes
- single quotes for enumerator literals
- double quotes for normal strings

- Avoid fancy-looking modern STL constructs, use basic `for` loops, avoid templates, keep it simple
- Vertical alignment makes things more readable and easier to batch edit
- Clean-up any trailing whitespaces, use 4 spaces for indentation, brackets on the same line, `void * ptr`, `int & a`
- Use sized integer types such as `int32_t` in the public API, e.g. `size_t` may also be appropriate for allocation sizes or byte offsets
- Avoid shadowing built-ins
- Prefix unused variables or arguments with an underscore.
- Imports may be placed inside functions or methods when appropriate to reduce startup time.
- Use str.format() instead of f-strings or % formatting.
- Avoid type annotations in core startup scripts unless required (for example, bpy.props).

For anything not covered here, follow:
- PEP 8
- Python documentation best practices

# Documentation

- Documentation is a community effort
- When you need to look into the source code to figure out how to use an API consider adding a short summary to the header file for future reference
- When you notice incorrect or outdated documentation, please update it
